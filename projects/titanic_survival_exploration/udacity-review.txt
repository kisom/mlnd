Answers to Each Question

1. The predictions_0 function has been run and the accuracy of the predictions
   is reported.

   Reviewer: The predictions_0 function provides the appropriate accuracy.

2. The predictions_1 function has been correctly implemented. The expected
   accuracy of the predictions is reported.

3. The predictions_2 function has been correctly implemented. The expected
   accuracy of the predictions is reported.

   Reviewer: Well done for using the appropriate conditioning that provides
   the appropriate accuracy.

4. The predictions_3 function has been correctly implemented and obtains a
   prediction accuracy of at least 80%. The approach to the task has been
   documented, including features that were explored and intermediate steps taken
   to complete the function.

   It is a good approach to consider different subcategories that might
   increase the overall information of the model. Did you try to consider
   subcategories with low survival rate? For example

       if (passenger['Sex'] == "female"):
            if (passenger['Pclass'] < 3):
                predictions.append(1)
            elif (passenger['Age'] > 40):
                predictions.append(0)
            else:
                predictions.append(1)

5. A valid scenario where supervised learning can be applied is reported. A
   clear outcome variable and at least two potential predictor variables are
   identified as part of the description.

   Reviewer: You are correct, supervised learning can definitely be applied to
   predict power grids. You might find this link useful, it includes different
   models implemented in Python. These models can be employed to solve
   different or even similar problems,

* Capstone project ideas

** Proposal

   A project proposal encompasses seven key points:

   + The project's domain background — the field of research where the project is derived;
   + A problem statement — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
   + The datasets and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem;
   + A solution statement — a the solution proposed for the problem given;
   + A benchmark model — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
   + A set of evaluation metrics — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
   + An outline of the project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.

** Candidate domains

   + power grid
   + agriculture
   + public health

** Interesting data sets
